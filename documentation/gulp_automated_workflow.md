Create a Gulp Automated workflow
===

An automated workflow helps you to save many hour of your time by using pre-programmed commands lines. Creating this tools is a bit like writing a recipes book, containing all the boring task you used to do. From now, we called this recipes book the __gulpfile__.

However creating such a workflow required you to spend some time first to develop it. However creating such a tool is difficult because you have to together a lot of technology and make them work together in the proper way.

The purpose of this documentation is to let you discover few technologies that I picked and integrated to my workflow and showed altenative choices to each of those technology. So you can understant my project and maybe start to build your own workflow.
