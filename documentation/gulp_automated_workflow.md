Create a Gulp Automated workflow
===

An automated workflow helps you to save many hour of your time by using pre-programmed commands lines. Creating this tools is a bit like writing a recipes book, containing all the boring task you used to do. From now, we called this recipes book the __gulpfile__.

However creating such a workflow required you to spend some time first to develop it. However creating such a tool is difficult because you have to together a lot of technology and make them work together in the proper way.

The purpose of this documentation is to let you discover few technologies that I picked and integrated to my workflow and showed altenative choices to each of those technology. So you can understant my project and maybe start to build your own workflow.

# Get Ready

Before you can start with your automated workflow you need to install some softwares.

Start by intall [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Node.js is a javaScript server, that's simply means it is a server reading/exectuting javaScript language. 

Node.js comes with a wery interesting tool witch is __npm__ a package manager. You will use npm to install, share, distribute code and manage dependencies. Npm it is also an [online platform](https://www.npmjs.com/) where you can find more than 250 000 package to create your workflow.

Lets install your first package with __npm__. You may have already find the name of this package.

> npm install gulp --save-dev
